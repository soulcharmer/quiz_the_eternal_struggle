	<p><b> Heidelberg Castle, Germany: Lock to move blood, equipment and/or retainers between any two ready vampires you control. Cannot be used during an action.</b></p>
	<p><b> Flaming Candle: Only one Flaming Candle can be played or equipped in a game. This vampire can burn 1 blood and the Flaming Candle as they announce an action to make that action unblockable by vampires.</b></p>

        <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
                <li>Moving equipment implies the receiving vampire equips it and thus it cannot be done.</li>
                <li>Moving isn't equipping, and the Castle can move the candle.</li>
                <li>A second Flaming Candle can be put into play with effects like Summon history or Magic of the Smith.</li>
                <li>If there are two Flaming Candles in play, the second one cannot be re-equipped or moved by the Heidelberg Castle.</li>
		<li>A vampire can equip the Flaming Candle from another vampire.</li>

	<p><b>Anesthetic Touch</b>: Only usable at close range. <b>[aus]</b> Strike: dodge. <b>[obe]</b> Strike: hand strike. Combat ends immediately after the resolution of this strike. <b>[OBE]</b> As above, with first strike.</p>
	<p><b>Dust Up</b>: Requires an Anarch. <b>[ani]</b> Strike: hand strike at +1 damage. This strike cannot be dodged. <b>[cel]</b> Strike: dodge, with 1 additional strike (limited). <b>[pot]</b> Strike: hand strike at +2 damage.</p>

        <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
                <li>Anesthetic Touch with first strike precedes the dodge, deals damage, and ends combat before the additional strike.</li>
                <li>Dust Up prevents the combat ends effect because it is part of the strike, and the additional strike hits Saulot.</li>
                <li>If both vampires dodge, Theo can forgo dealing the additional strike (if they do not really want to fight).</li>
                <li>If Saulot is the acting minion, he can play an additional strike of his own before combat ends.</li>
                <li>If Saulot somehow played Catatonic Fear instead, combat still ends and Theo gets hit.</li>
